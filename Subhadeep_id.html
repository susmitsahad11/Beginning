                  <li> I like capturing people when they're happy and when they're awkward, so yeah I like photography.</li>
                  <li> I can absolutely binge-watch tv shows for days at a stretch so bring the new season on!</li>
                  <li> And I saved the best for the last. Pass me a football and I'll be ready to play till the first one dies. </li>

        <h2> Ambitions</h2>

        <p>
            Let's just say that I'll try to make changes in my own small ways until they get bigger and bigger. <br>
            And did I tell you that I want a sports car? Buy me one for the time being, please? I'll buy you Hot Wheels. Deal?
